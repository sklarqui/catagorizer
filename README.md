#Day 5 Homework

* Categorize stuff! Separate flicks into genres, or separate movies from TV shows! Make a whole new thing with categories, like messages separated into channels! Use your tremendous creativity! Exclamation point!

* Or heck, just make separate lists based on the second input field you added in the weekend homework!

##Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Add a search field, and only show the results that match the search criteria. Here are some things you may wish to use while implementing search:

* Array.prototype.find() (very similar to findIndex())
* HTMLElement.dataset (remember those IDs we stored?)
* display: none (Heck, you could add a class that includes this rule, and add and move that class from elements you wish to hide.)
